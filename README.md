# 🚗 AutoCare

**AutoCare** is a comprehensive mobile platform built with **React Native** that connects your smartphone to your vehicle’s OBD-II system. Designed for modern automotive needs, it empowers users with real-time diagnostics, AI assistance, predictive maintenance, and offline functionality—all wrapped in a sleek, performant, and secure architecture.

## 📱 Key Features

- **Real-Time OBD-II Integration:** Live data from vehicle sensors via WebSocket

- **AI Assistant:** Multimodal chat (voice, image, text) powered by NLP and vision models

- **Predictive Maintenance:** Machine learning-based failure prediction (oil, brakes, battery)

- **Location Services:** Nearby service center discovery with smart ranking and routing

- **Offline Support:** Dual JWT token architecture for local + remote access

- **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based, biometric-ready, encrypted storage

- **Modern UI/UX:** Automotive-inspired glassmorphism design, responsive layouts, 60 FPS animations
